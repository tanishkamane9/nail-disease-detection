# 🩺 Nail Disease Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an Early Stage Nail Disease Diagnosis System built using Deep Learning (VGG16).  
It predicts nail diseases from uploaded nail images using a trained CNN model.

## 🧠 Model Used
- VGG16 (Transfer Learning)
- Input Size: 224 x 224
- Total Classes: 17 Nail Diseases

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- Git & GitHub
