    <h2>OUR PROJECT ON NAIL DISEASE</h2>
    <p>Human nail can be used for the prediction of various systemic and dermatological diseases. The proposed system – Nail Image Processing System helps us to the analysis of human nail in microscopic images. Nail Image Processing System employed to capture the nail portion is segmented and cut also, shape and texture features are extracted and taken together to form a feature vector and their analysis of nail is done which is beneficial for the diagnosis of various nail diseases is proposed system will help the doctors to the early diagnosis of diseases.</p>
